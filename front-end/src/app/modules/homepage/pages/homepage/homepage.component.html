						Hi everyone, we are Han Chi Chiu, Lee Kin Ming, Lee Tsz Leung. Welcome to our FYP webpage. In here, you 
									can learn more about Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme and get a hand on experience of how
									this encryption method can benifit you daily lift and make you secret security. Let's go!

								<h1>What is "Secret Sharing"?</h1>
								<p>
									In cryptograph, secret sharing refers to any method for distributing a
									secret among a group of participants, each of which allocates a share of the secret.
									The secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are combined together;
									individual shares are of no use on their own.
								</p>
								<p>
									The secret is opened only when specific conditions are fulfilled.
									 Each of n participants is given a number of share, and any group 
									 of t (threshold) or more shares together can open the secret but no group of less than t shares can.
								</p>
								<p>
									A secure secret sharing scheme distributes shares so that anyone with fewer than t shares has no more 
									information about the secret than someone with 0 shares. Consider the naive secret sharing scheme in which 
									the secret phrase "password" is divided into the shares "pa------," "--ss----," "----wo--," and "------rd,". 
									A person with 0 shares knows only that the password consists of eight letters. He would have to guess the password 
									from 268 = 208 billion possible combinations. A person with one share, however, would have to guess only the six letters 
									from 266 = 308 million combinations. This system is not a secure secret sharing scheme, because a player with less than t 
									shares gains significant information about the content of the secret. In a secure scheme, even a player missing only one 
									share should still face 268 = 208 billion combinations.
