                            <p>
                                In cryptograph, secret sharing refers to any method for distributing a
                                secret among a group of participants, each of which allocates a share of the secret.
                                The secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are combined together;
                                individual shares are of no use on their own.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The secret is opened only when specific conditions are fulfilled.
                                 Each of n participants is given a number of share, and any group 
                                 of t (threshold) or more shares together can open the secret but no group of less than t shares can.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A secure secret sharing scheme distributes shares so that anyone with fewer than t shares has no more 
                                information about the secret than someone with 0 shares. Consider the naive secret sharing scheme in which 
                                the secret phrase "password" is divided into the shares "pa------," "--ss----," "----wo--," and "------rd,". 
                                A person with 0 shares knows only that the password consists of eight letters. He would have to guess the password 
                                from 268 = 208 billion possible combinations. A person with one share, however, would have to guess only the six letters 
                                from 266 = 308 million combinations. This system is not a secure secret sharing scheme, because a player with less than t 
                                shares gains significant information about the content of the secret. In a secure scheme, even a player missing only one 
                                share should still face 268 = 208 billion combinations.
